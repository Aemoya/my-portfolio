                <p>Alexandra Moya is a Texas-based Hispanic artist currently pursuing her BFA in Painting and Ceramics at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. Primarily working with acrylics, she often pushes creative boundaries by experimenting with diverse mediums and forms. A compelling example is her piece "Shroud," which brilliantly integrates 3D sculpture with insulation foam. Beyond the canvas, Alexandra is passionate about ceramic pottery, frequently innovating with her glazing techniques. Her art is a vibrant reflection of her immediate emotions and the unique inspirations that ignite her artistic vision.</p>
