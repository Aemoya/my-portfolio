<!--
    User Prompt:
    Create a complete HTML5 page named basic.html. Add a centered <h1> heading and a short <p> paragraph. Link to an external CSS file (css/basic.css)
    that sets the background color to white and the text color to black.
    Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag,
    class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete
    beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include
    named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior.
    Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use
    placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the
    page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
    This is the DOCTYPE declaration. It tells the web browser that this document
    is an HTML5 document. It's a crucial first line for modern web pages.
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
    This is the root element of an HTML page. All other HTML elements
    (except the DOCTYPE) are descendants of this element.
    The 'lang="en"' attribute specifies the language of the document content
    as English. This is important for accessibility (screen readers) and
    search engine optimization (SEO).
-->
<head>
    <!--
        The <head> element contains meta-information about the HTML document.
        This information is not displayed directly on the web page itself,
        but it's essential for browsers, search engines, and other web services.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
        The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
        UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character
        and symbol in the world, making it the recommended and most widely used
        encoding for web pages. It ensures that text (like special characters or
        emojis) is displayed correctly across different browsers and devices.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
        The <meta name="viewport"> tag is crucial for responsive web design.
        It controls how the page is displayed on mobile devices.
        - 'width=device-width': Sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device screen.
          This means if you're on a phone, the page will try to fit the phone's screen width.
        - 'initial-scale=1.0': Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
          A value of 1.0 means no zoom, so the page appears at its actual size.
          Together, these attributes ensure the page scales correctly and looks good
          on various screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones.

    <title>The Art of Impressionism</title>
    <!--
        The <title> element defines the title of the HTML document.
        This title appears in the browser's title bar or tab. It's also
        what search engines display as the clickable headline in search results.
        Choosing a descriptive title is good for both user experience and SEO.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/basic.css">
    <!--
        The <link> element is used to link an external resource to the HTML document.
        In this case, it links to an external CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file.
        - 'rel="stylesheet"': Specifies the relationship between the current document
          and the linked document. Here, it indicates that the linked file is a stylesheet.
        - 'href="css/basic.css"': Specifies the URL (or path) of the external stylesheet.
          'css/basic.css' means the browser should look for a folder named 'css'
          in the same directory as this HTML file, and inside that folder,
          it should find a file named 'basic.css'. This separation of HTML (content)
          and CSS (presentation) is a fundamental best practice in web development,
          making code easier to manage, read, and update.
    -->
</head>
<body>
    <!--
        The <body> element contains all the visible content of an HTML document.
        Everything you see on a web page – text, images, links, videos, etc. –
        is placed within the <body> tags.
    -->
    <header>
        <!--
            The <header> element represents introductory content, typically
            a group of introductory or navigational aids. It often contains
            headings, logos, search forms, and navigation links.
            In this simple page, it just holds our main heading.
        -->
        <h1 class="centered-text">The Luminous World of Impressionism</h1>
        <!--
            The <h1> element defines the most important heading on the page.
            There should typically only be one <h1> per page for semantic reasons
            and SEO.
            The 'class="centered-text"' attribute applies a CSS class named
            'centered-text' to this heading. This class will be defined in our
            'basic.css' file to apply specific styling, in this case, centering the text.
            Using classes allows us to apply the same style to multiple elements
            or to target specific elements for styling.
        -->
    </header>

    <main>
        <!--
            The <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body>.
            It should contain content that is unique to this document and
            should not include content that is repeated across a set of documents
            (like sidebars, navigation links, copyright information).
            It helps with document structure and accessibility.
        -->
        <p class="centered-text">
            <!--
                The <p> element defines a paragraph. It's used for blocks of text.
                Like the <h1>, it also uses the 'class="centered-text"' to ensure
                its content is centered on the page, maintaining a consistent layout.
            -->
            Impressionism, an art movement that emerged in the 19th century,
            revolutionized painting by focusing on capturing the fleeting
            impressions of light, color, and atmosphere rather than precise detail.
            Artists like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas
            used visible brushstrokes, open composition, and an emphasis on light
            in its changing qualities to depict modern life and landscapes.
            Their innovative approach paved the way for modern art.
        </p>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!--
            The <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content
            or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about
            its section, such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data,
            and the like. In this simple example, it's just a placeholder.
        -->
        <p class="centered-text">Explore the beauty of light and color.</p>
    </footer>

        ### Named Comment: Color Scheme
        This page employs a very minimalist and high-contrast color scheme:
        - Background Color: White (#FFFFFF) - Chosen for its clean, bright, and neutral appearance,
          which allows the text to stand out clearly and provides a classic, readable canvas.
        - Text Color: Black (#000000) - Chosen for maximum contrast against the white background,
          ensuring excellent readability for all users, including those with visual impairments.
        This scheme prioritizes clarity and accessibility.

        ### Named Comment: Interaction Behavior
        This is a static HTML page, meaning it does not include any interactive elements
        (like buttons that trigger actions, forms, or JavaScript-driven animations).
        Therefore, there is no specific "interaction behavior" to describe beyond
        the default browser behavior for viewing a web page (e.g., scrolling).
        All content is purely for display.
