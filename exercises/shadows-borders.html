<!--
Create a complete HTML5 page named shadows-borders.html
 that displays three visually distinct content boxes side by side. Use
CSS Flexbox to align them horizontally across the page. Each box should
have a unique combination of border style (solid, dashed, or double) and
 box-shadow settings to suggest visual depth and separation. Link to an
external stylesheet at css/shadows-borders.css to handle
all layout and styling. Comment on each box’s visual treatment and how
it contributes to a sense of hierarchy or depth. Write neurotically
detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule,
and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the
reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments
describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include this full
prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder
content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
This is the document type declaration. It tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
It's crucial for ensuring modern rendering behavior.
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML page.
The 'lang="en"' attribute specifies the language of the document content as English.
This is important for accessibility (screen readers) and search engine optimization.
-->
<head>
    <!--
    The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document.
    This information is not displayed directly on the web page but is used by browsers,
    search engines, and other web services.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    UTF-8 is a universal character encoding that supports almost all characters and symbols
    in the world, preventing display issues with special characters.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
    The <meta name="viewport"> tag is essential for responsive web design.
    - 'width=device-width' sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device screen.
    - 'initial-scale=1.0' sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
    This ensures the page scales correctly on different devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).

    <title>Shadows and Borders - Art Exploration</title>
    <!--
    The <title> tag sets the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser's
    title bar or tab. It's important for user experience and search engine optimization.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/shadows-borders.css">
    <!--
    The <link> tag is used to link an external resource to the HTML document.
    - 'rel="stylesheet"' specifies that the linked document is a stylesheet.
    - 'href="css/shadows-borders.css"' provides the path to our external CSS file.
    This separation of HTML structure and CSS styling is a best practice for maintainability
    and organization.

    <header class="page-header">
        <!--
        The <header> tag represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory
        or navigational aids. Here, it holds the main title of our page.
        The 'page-header' class is used for specific styling of this header.
        -->
        <h1>The Art of Depth: Impressionism Through Borders and Shadows</h1>
        <!--
        The <h1> tag defines the most important heading on the page.
        It's good practice to have only one <h1> per page for semantic clarity and SEO.

    </header>

    <main class="container">
        <!--
        The <main> tag represents the dominant content of the <body>.
        It should be unique to the document and should not contain content that is repeated
        across a group of documents (like sidebars, navigation links, copyright information).
        The 'container' class is crucial here, as it will be styled with CSS Flexbox
        to arrange its child elements (the content boxes) horizontally.

        <section class="content-box box-one">
            <!--
            The <section> tag groups related content. Here, each section represents
            a distinct content box.
            - 'content-box' is a general class applied to all boxes for common styling.
            - 'box-one' is a specific class for unique styling of this particular box.

            <!--
            The <img> tag embeds an image into the document.
            - 'src' attribute specifies the path to the image. Using a placeholder service
              like placehold.co allows us to generate images on the fly for demonstration.
              The dimensions (400x250), background color (#E0BBE4), text color (#FFFFFF),
              and text content ("Monet's Water Lilies") are specified in the URL.
            - 'alt' attribute provides alternative text for the image. This is vital for
              accessibility (screen readers describe the image) and for when the image
              cannot be displayed (e.g., broken link).

            <p>
                Claude Monet, a founder of French Impressionist painting, is known for his
                series paintings, which depict the same subject at different times of day
                and in varying light conditions. His "Water Lilies" series, in particular,
                explores the interplay of light on water and the subtle shifts in color
                and reflection. This box aims to evoke a sense of delicate observation,
                much like Monet's approach to capturing fleeting moments.
            </p>
            <!--
            The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text.

            <!--
            Visual Treatment for Box One:
            This box features a 'solid' border and a subtle, soft box-shadow.
            The solid border provides a clear, defined edge, suggesting stability and directness.
            The soft, diffused shadow (small offset, large blur, light color) creates a gentle
            lift from the page, giving it a sense of being slightly raised and accessible.
            This treatment contributes to a feeling of primary focus, a foundational element
            that is present and clear, much like the foundational role of Monet in Impressionism.
            It's not aggressively popping out but is distinctly present.

            <p>
                Edgar Degas, though often associated with Impressionism, preferred to be
                called a Realist or Independent. He focused on capturing movement,
                especially of dancers and bathers, often using unusual angles and compositions.
                His work explored the human form in motion, emphasizing line and form over
                the pure play of light. This box aims for a dynamic, yet contained, feel.
            </p>
            <!--
            Visual Treatment for Box Two:
            This box uses a 'dashed' border and a more pronounced, directional box-shadow.
            The dashed border introduces a sense of rhythm or broken continuity, hinting at
            movement or a less rigid structure, much like the dynamic poses in Degas' work.
            The box-shadow is offset more significantly to one side (bottom-right), giving
            the impression that light is coming from a specific direction, casting a more
            defined shadow. This creates a stronger sense of depth and separation from the
            page, suggesting a secondary, perhaps more active or specific, element in the hierarchy.
            It feels like it's "leaning" or moving slightly.

            <h2>Renoir's Joyful Portraits</h2>

            <p>
                Pierre-Auguste Renoir was a leading painter in the development of the
                Impressionist style. He is celebrated for his vibrant and light-filled
                paintings of real life, particularly portraits and figure paintings.
                Renoir's work often conveys a sense of joy and intimacy, focusing on
                the beauty of human interaction and the softness of flesh. This box
                seeks to convey a sense of warmth and inviting presence.
            </p>
            <!--
            Visual Treatment for Box Three:
            This box utilizes a 'double' border and a subtle, multi-layered box-shadow.
            The double border provides a sophisticated, almost framed look, suggesting
            elegance and perhaps a deeper, more complex structure. It gives a sense of
            being a "window" or a more formal presentation.
            The box-shadow, with multiple layers (one subtle, one slightly more defined),
            creates a richer, more nuanced sense of depth. It doesn't just "lift" but
            seems to have a subtle glow or a layered presence, making it feel more
            "important" or "special" – perhaps drawing the eye as a highlight.
            This contributes to a sense of elevated status or a focal point,
            a more refined element in the visual hierarchy.
