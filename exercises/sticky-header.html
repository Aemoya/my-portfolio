<!--
Full Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named sticky-header.html with a sticky navigation header that remains fixed to the top of the viewport as the user scrolls. The header should contain a branding element on the left (such as a site name or logo), and a simple navigation menu on the right with links to at least three in-page sections. If you include a dropdown menu in the header (optional), make sure it is fully visible and not clipped by overflow issues—use position: absolute for the dropdown and ensure no parent container has overflow: hidden or overflow: auto that could cut it off. Below the header, add at least three scrollable content sections (e.g., full-screen-height) to demonstrate sticky behavior. Style everything using an external CSS file located at css/sticky-header.css. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

    The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document,
    such as its character set, viewport settings, and links to external resources like CSS.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character and symbol
    in the world, ensuring proper display of text regardless of language.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
    The <meta name="viewport"> tag is crucial for responsive web design.
    - `width=device-width`: Sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen.
    - `initial-scale=1.0`: Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
    Together, these ensure the page scales correctly on various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).

    <title>Artistry Archive - Sticky Header</title>
    <!--
    The <title> tag defines the title of the document, which appears in the browser's
    title bar or tab. It's important for SEO and user experience.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/sticky-header.css">
    <!--
    The <link> tag is used to link an external stylesheet to the HTML document.
    - `rel="stylesheet"`: Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document (it's a stylesheet).
    - `href="css/sticky-header.css"`: Specifies the URL of the external stylesheet.
    This separates content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

    <header class="main-header">
        <!--
        The <header> tag represents introductory content, usually containing
        a group of navigational aids. Here, it holds the site branding and main navigation.
        The `main-header` class will be used in CSS to apply specific styles,
        including making it sticky.

            This <div> element acts as a container for the site's branding (name or logo).

            <h1>Artistry Archive</h1>
            <!--
            The <h1> tag represents the most important heading on the page.

                The <ul> (unordered list) tag is used to create a list of items.
                Here, it's used for the main navigation links.
                The `nav-list` class helps style the list items horizontally.

                <li class="nav-item"><a href="#masterpieces">Masterpieces</a></li>
                <!--
                The <li> (list item) tag represents an item in a list.
                The `nav-item` class is for individual link styling.
                The <a> (anchor) tag creates a hyperlink.
                - `href="#masterpieces"`: This is an "in-page" link. When clicked, it will scroll the page
                  to the element with the `id="masterpieces"`. This is how we link to specific sections.

                    <a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle">Explore More &#9662;</a>
                    <!--
                    The `dropdown-toggle` class is for styling the clickable part of the dropdown.
                    `&#9662;` is the HTML entity for a downward-pointing triangle, indicating a dropdown.
                    The `href="#"` prevents the link from navigating away, as its purpose is to toggle the dropdown.

                        It will use `position: absolute` to ensure it's not clipped by parent `overflow` properties.
