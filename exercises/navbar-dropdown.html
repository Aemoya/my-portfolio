            <h2>The Abstract Expressionist Movement</h2>
            <p>Abstract Expressionism, which emerged in the 1940s in New York City, was the first American art movement to achieve worldwide influence and put New York City at the center of the art world. Artists like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning focused on spontaneous, unconscious creation, valuing the process of painting itself. Their large-scale works were often characterized by energetic brushstrokes, intense colors, and a lack of recognizable subjects, aiming instead to evoke emotion and intellectual engagement directly from the viewer.</p>

            <h3>Key Figures and Innovations</h3>
            <p><strong>Jackson Pollock</strong>, known for his "drip" technique, revolutionized painting by laying his canvas on the floor and pouring or dripping paint onto it, creating intricate patterns that captured movement and energy. This method was less about composition and more about the physical act of creation.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark Rothko</strong> developed a signature style of large, rectangular blocks of color on canvases, often referred to as "color field" painting. His work aimed to immerse the viewer in color, creating a meditative or spiritual experience through subtle variations in hue and light.</p>
            <p><strong>Willem de Kooning</strong> maintained a more gestural approach, often incorporating figural elements, though highly distorted. His "Woman" series, for instance, combined aggressive brushwork with fragmented representations of the female form, challenging traditional notions of beauty and representation.</p>
            <p>This movement reflected the post-war mood of anxiety and existential questioning, offering a powerful, introspective art form that continues to influence contemporary artists today.</p>
