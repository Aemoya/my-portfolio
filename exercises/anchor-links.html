            <h2>Roots of Impressionism</h2>
            <!-- The <h2> tag represents a second-level heading. -->
            <p>
                Impressionism, a radical art movement that emerged in the 1870s, marked a profound departure
                from the academic traditions of the past. Its roots can be traced to a growing dissatisfaction
                among young artists with the rigid rules and historical subjects favored by the French Salon.
                Instead of grand narratives or idealized figures, these artists sought to capture the fleeting
                impressions of light, color, and atmosphere in everyday life. They were influenced by new
                technologies like photography, which offered a fresh perspective on capturing moments, and by
                the burgeoning interest in Japanese ukiyo-e prints, known for their flattened perspectives and
                bold compositions. The industrial revolution also played a role, as new pigments became
                available, allowing for brighter and more vibrant colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Artists like Édouard Manet, though not strictly an Impressionist, paved the way with his
                innovative brushwork and controversial subjects that challenged the establishment. His
                emphasis on the flatness of the canvas and the directness of his gaze encouraged others to
                break free. The Barbizon School, a group of French landscape painters, also influenced the
                Impressionists by advocating for painting outdoors (en plein air), directly observing nature
                rather than relying on studio compositions. This practice became a cornerstone of the
                Impressionist approach, allowing them to study the subtle changes in light and shadow
                throughout the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term "Impressionism" itself was coined by a critic, Louis Leroy, in a sarcastic review
                of Claude Monet's painting "Impression, Sunrise" (1872). Leroy intended it as an insult,
                suggesting the paintings were merely "impressions" and unfinished sketches. However, the
                artists embraced the term, turning a derogatory label into the name of their revolutionary
                movement. This period was characterized by a desire to capture the immediate visual
                sensation, often with visible brushstrokes and a focus on the effects of light on color.
            </p>
            <p>
                The shift from traditional studio painting to outdoor observation was monumental. Artists
                began to notice how colors changed depending on the time of day, weather conditions, and
                the presence of other colors. They experimented with broken brushstrokes and pure,
                unmixed colors applied directly to the canvas, allowing the viewer's eye to blend them
                from a distance. This technique aimed to convey the vibrancy and dynamism of the scene
                as perceived by the artist in a single moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, the social and cultural changes of the late 19th century in Paris, such as
                the rise of the bourgeoisie and new leisure activities, provided the Impressionists with
                fresh subject matter. They depicted scenes of modern life: cafes, boulevards, ballet dancers,
                and landscapes, reflecting the changing urban environment and the everyday experiences of
                people. This focus on contemporary life, combined with their innovative techniques,
                solidified Impressionism's place as a pivotal movement in art history.

            <h2>Key Impressionist Artists and Techniques</h2>
            <p>
                The Impressionist movement was propelled by a core group of artists who shared a common vision
                and often exhibited together. Claude Monet is perhaps the most iconic, known for his serial
                paintings of haystacks, Rouen Cathedral, and water lilies, which meticulously explored the
                effect of light and atmosphere over time. His dedication to capturing the fleeting moment
                through variations in light is central to the Impressionist ethos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pierre-Auguste Renoir, on the other hand, was celebrated for his vibrant depictions of
                people, particularly women and children, in everyday settings. His paintings often exude a
                sense of joy and warmth, capturing the beauty of human interaction and leisure. Edgar Degas
                focused on subjects like ballet dancers and laundresses, capturing candid moments with
                unusual angles and compositions, often influenced by photography and Japanese prints.
            </p>
            <p>
                Camille Pissarro was a foundational figure, often considered the "father" of Impressionism,
                who consistently experimented with light and color, and was a mentor to many younger artists.
                Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, two prominent female Impressionists, brought unique
                perspectives to domestic scenes and the lives of women, challenging traditional gender roles
                in the art world. Alfred Sisley specialized in landscapes, capturing the subtle nuances of
                the French countryside.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key techniques employed by these artists included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Visible Brushstrokes:</strong> Short, thick brushstrokes that are distinct and
                    often applied side-by-side, allowing colors to blend optically in the viewer's eye
                    rather than on the palette. This technique gives a sense of immediacy and texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Emphasis on Light:</strong> A strong focus on the changing qualities of light,
                    often depicting the effects of sunlight, reflections, and shadows in various conditions.
                    They understood that light affects local color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Open Composition:</strong> Often featuring uncentered or asymmetrical compositions,
                    sometimes cropping figures or objects at the edges, giving the impression of a snapshot
                    or a momentary glimpse. This was influenced by photography.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pure, Unmixed Colors:</strong> Using colors directly from the tube, often placed
                    next to each other rather than mixed, to create a vibrant and luminous effect. Shadows
                    were often painted with blues and purples rather than black or brown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>"En Plein Air" Painting:</strong> The practice of painting outdoors, directly
                    from nature, to capture the immediate sensory experience of light and atmosphere. This
                    required portable easels and pre-mixed paints in tubes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ordinary Subject Matter:</strong> Depicting scenes of modern life, landscapes,
                    cityscapes, and portraits of ordinary people, rather than historical, mythological, or
                    religious themes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These techniques collectively allowed the Impressionists to break away from the academic
                traditions that emphasized precise drawing and smooth finishes, paving the way for more
                expressive and abstract forms of art. Their revolutionary approach to color, light, and
                subject matter fundamentally changed the course of Western art.

        <section id="post-impressionism" class="content-section">
            <h2>Post-Impressionism: A New Direction</h2>
            <p>
                While Impressionism revolutionized art, its focus on fleeting moments and objective observation
                left some artists yearning for more emotional depth and symbolic meaning. This led to the
                emergence of Post-Impressionism, a diverse movement that built upon Impressionist innovations
                but pushed art in new, individualistic directions. Occurring roughly between 1886 and 1905,
                Post-Impressionism was not a unified style but rather a collection of artists who reacted to
                or extended Impressionism in unique ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key figures like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, and Georges Seurat, while
                initially influenced by Impressionism, developed distinct styles. Van Gogh, for instance,
                used vibrant, swirling brushstrokes and intense colors to express his inner emotional state,
                moving far beyond mere visual impressions. His work, such as "The Starry Night," is a testament
                to the power of art to convey feeling rather than just reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul Cézanne, on the other hand, sought to bring structure and permanence back to art. He
                analyzed forms in terms of geometric shapes (cylinders, spheres, cones) and used multiple
                viewpoints within a single painting, laying the groundwork for Cubism. His methodical
                approach to still life and landscape aimed to capture the underlying structure of nature,
                rather than its ephemeral surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul Gauguin rejected the materialism of modern life and sought inspiration in exotic cultures,
                particularly Tahiti. He developed a style known as Synthetism, characterized by flat areas of
                color, strong outlines, and symbolic content, moving away from direct observation towards
                imagination and memory. His work often explored spiritual and mythical themes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Georges Seurat developed Pointillism (also known as Divisionism), a meticulous technique
                where small, distinct dots of pure color are applied in patterns to form an image. This
                scientific approach to color theory aimed to achieve maximum luminosity and brilliance
                through optical mixing, a more controlled evolution of Impressionist color theory. His
                masterpiece, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," exemplifies this
                labor-intensive method.
            </p>
            <p>
                Post-Impressionism, despite its varied approaches, shared a common thread: a desire to
                emphasize symbolic content, emotional expression, and structural form, rather than solely
                focusing on the objective depiction of light and color. It served as a crucial bridge
                between Impressionism and the radical art movements of the early 20th century, including
                Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism.

            <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
            <p>
                The impact of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism on the trajectory of modern art cannot
                be overstated. Impressionism liberated artists from the constraints of academic tradition,
                validating subjective perception and the artist's individual experience as legitimate
                subject matter. It opened the door for art to be about the act of seeing itself, and the
                artist's unique interpretation of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its emphasis on light, color, and visible brushwork directly influenced subsequent movements.
                Fauvism, for example, took the Impressionists' use of vibrant, unmixed colors and pushed
                it further, using color expressively and arbitrarily, rather than descriptively.
                Expressionism, particularly German Expressionism, drew on the Post-Impressionist emphasis
                on emotional content and distorted forms to convey inner feelings and psychological states.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cézanne's analytical approach to form and space directly inspired Cubism, pioneered by
                Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. His idea of breaking down objects into geometric components
                and depicting them from multiple angles was a revolutionary concept that fundamentally
                changed how artists perceived and represented reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Impressionists' focus on everyday life and leisure scenes also had a lasting impact,
                shifting the art world's attention from historical and mythological subjects to the
                contemporary world. This paved the way for realism and social commentary in art, influencing
                movements like Ashcan School in America.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond specific movements, Impressionism fostered a general spirit of experimentation and
                innovation. It encouraged artists to develop their own unique styles and to challenge
                established norms, leading to the explosion of diverse art movements in the 20th century.
                The idea that art could be about personal experience, emotion, and formal qualities,
                rather than just narrative or representation, became a cornerstone of modern art.
                Today, Impressionist paintings remain among the most beloved and recognized works of art,
                continuing to captivate audiences with their beauty, light, and timeless appeal.
