<!--
Create a complete HTML5 page named parallax.html
that demonstrates a parallax scrolling effect using multiple sections.
Use a combination of solid-colored and parallax-image sections to create
clear visual contrast as the user scrolls. Structure the layout with
the following sequence: (1) a solid background section with a large
heading as the page title (let the height be auto based on content), (2) a parallax section using images/parallax.jpg
set to 25% of the viewport height, (3) a solid section with a heading
and at least three paragraphs discussing an art-related topic, (4)
another parallax section at 10% viewport height, and (5) a final solid
section with additional paragraph content. Style everything using css/parallax.css, and use background-attachment: fixed
in the parallax sections. Ensure text is readable and well-padded.
Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag,
class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete
beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include
named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior.
Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use
placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the
page.

    The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document,
    such as its title, links to stylesheets, and character set.
    This information is not displayed on the web page itself but is crucial
    for browsers and search engines.

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character
    and symbol in the world, ensuring that text is displayed correctly across
    different languages and platforms.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
    The <meta name="viewport"> tag is essential for responsive web design.
    - "width=device-width" sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device.
    - "initial-scale=1.0" sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
    This ensures the page scales correctly on various devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

    <title>Parallax Scrolling Art Journey</title>
    <!--
    The <title> tag defines the title of the HTML document, which appears
    in the browser's title bar or tab. It's also used by search engines.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/parallax.css">
    <!--
    The <link> tag is used to link an external resource to the HTML document.
    - "rel="stylesheet"" specifies that the linked document is a stylesheet.
    - "href="css/parallax.css"" provides the path to the external CSS file.
    This separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making
    the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

            <h2>The Evolution of Impressionism: Capturing Fleeting Moments</h2>
            <!--

            <p>
                Impressionism, an art movement that emerged in the 19th century, revolutionized the way artists perceived and depicted the world.
                Breaking away from traditional academic painting, Impressionists focused on capturing the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere,
                often painting en plein air (outdoors) to observe natural light conditions directly. This emphasis on immediate perception,
                rather than precise detail, gave their works a fresh, vibrant, and often unfinished quality, challenging the established norms of the time.
            </p>
            <!--
            The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text. It's the standard way to
            structure blocks of prose content.
            -->
            <p>
                Key figures like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro were central to the movement.
                Monet, in particular, is renowned for his series paintings, such as "Water Lilies" and "Rouen Cathedral," where he explored
                how light transformed the same subject at different times of day or in varying weather conditions. These series exemplify
                the Impressionist commitment to observing and recording the ephemeral nature of reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The initial reception of Impressionism was often critical, with many viewers and critics finding the paintings crude or unfinished.
                However, its influence grew, paving the way for subsequent modern art movements like Post-Impressionism and Fauvism.
                Today, Impressionism is celebrated for its innovative techniques, its vibrant palette, and its profound impact on the trajectory of Western art,
                reminding us that beauty can be found in the transient and the subjective.

            <h2>Art's Enduring Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Art, in its myriad forms, continues to serve as a powerful mirror to humanity's aspirations, fears, and triumphs.
                From ancient cave paintings to contemporary digital installations, each era leaves its unique artistic fingerprint,
                offering insights into the cultural, social, and technological landscapes of its time. It challenges perceptions,
                evokes emotions, and fosters dialogue, proving that its relevance is as profound today as it was centuries ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engaging with art, whether through creation or appreciation, enriches our lives by expanding our understanding
                of ourselves and the world around us. It encourages critical thinking, empathy, and a deeper connection to the human experience.
                As we scroll through the digital canvas of this page, we are reminded that art, much like the changing light,
                is a continuous, evolving narrative waiting to be explored.
