<!--
Full Prompt: Create a complete responsive HTML5 page named media-embed.html
that includes two embedded elements: a YouTube video and a Google Map
iframe. Use the following YouTube video URL for the embed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7poP4QV7kU.
For the map, embed a Google Map of the Tate Modern in London. Center
both embeds on the page and ensure they resize properly across all
screen sizes, including mobile devices. Wrap each iframe in a responsive
container if necessary to preserve aspect ratio and responsiveness.
Link to an external stylesheet at css/media-embed.css to
control all layout and appearance. Write neurotically detailed comments
in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as
if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each
choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme
and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the
top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your
choice to complete the page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
  The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines this document to be an HTML5 document.
  It's crucial for browsers to render the page in standards mode.
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
  The `<html>` tag is the root element of an HTML page.
  The `lang="en"` attribute specifies the language of the document content,
  which helps search engines and assistive technologies (like screen readers).
-->
<head>
  <!--
    The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the HTML document,
    such as its title, links to stylesheets, and other metadata. This content
    is not directly visible on the web page itself.
  -->

  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!--
    The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes almost all characters and symbols
    in the world, ensuring that text displays correctly across different languages and platforms.
  -->

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <!--
    The `<meta name="viewport" ...>` tag is critical for responsive web design.
    - `width=device-width`: Sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device screen.
      This means the page will take up the full available width on any device.
    - `initial-scale=1.0`: Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
      A value of 1.0 means no zoom, displaying the page at its actual size, which is
      essential for consistent rendering across devices.
  -->

  <title>Art & Immersion: Media Embeds</title>
  <!--
    The `<title>` tag defines the title of the HTML document. This title appears
    in the browser's title bar or tab, and is also used by search engines.
  -->

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/media-embed.css">
  <!--
    The `<link>` tag is used to link an external resource to the HTML document.
    - `rel="stylesheet"`: Specifies the relationship of the linked document to the current document,
      indicating that it's a stylesheet.
    - `href="css/media-embed.css"`: Specifies the URL (path) of the external stylesheet file.
      This means all styling for this HTML page will be defined in the `media-embed.css` file
      located in the `css` folder.
  -->
</head>
<body>
  <!--
    The `<body>` section contains all the visible content of the HTML document,
    such as text, images, videos, maps, and other elements that users interact with.
  -->

  <div class="container">
    <!--
      The `<div>` tag is a generic container for flow content. It's used here
      to group and structure the main content of the page.
      The `class="container"` attribute assigns a CSS class, allowing us to
      apply specific styling (like centering and max-width) to this element
      via the `media-embed.css` stylesheet.
    -->

    <header>
      <!--
        The `<header>` tag represents introductory content, typically containing
        a group of navigational aids or introductory headings.
      -->
      <h1>Exploring Modern Art Through Digital Media</h1>
      <!--
        The `<h1>` tag defines the most important heading on the page.
        It's used here for the main title of the content.
      -->
    </header>

    <main>
      <!--
        The `<main>` tag represents the dominant content of the `<body>` of a document.
        It's a semantic tag that helps define the main content area of the page.
      -->

      <section class="content-section">
        <!--
          The `<section>` tag represents a standalone section of content, which doesn't
          have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Here, it's used to
          group related content, like the video embed and its accompanying text.
          The `class="content-section"` allows for specific styling of these sections.
        -->
        <h2>The Abstract Expressionist Movement</h2>
        <!--
          The `<h2>` tag defines a secondary heading, typically used for section titles.
        -->
        <p>
          Abstract Expressionism, a post-World War II art movement, emerged in New York City
          in the 1940s. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve worldwide
          influence and put New York City at the center of the art world. Artists like
          Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko sought to express emotions and ideas through
          large-scale, non-representational works. This movement emphasized spontaneous,
          subconscious creation, often involving dynamic brushstrokes and intense color fields.
        </p>

        <h3>Watch: A Deep Dive into Abstract Expressionism</h3>
        <!--
          The `<h3>` tag defines a tertiary heading, providing further sub-section titles.
        -->
        <div class="video-responsive">
          <!--
            This `<div>` with `class="video-responsive"` is a crucial container for
            making the embedded YouTube video responsive.
            In `media-embed.css`, this class will apply styles that maintain the
            16:9 aspect ratio of the video as the screen size changes.
            This is achieved by using `position: relative;`, `padding-bottom: 56.25%;`
            (which is 9/16 * 100%), `height: 0;`, and `overflow: hidden;`.

          </iframe>
          <!--
            The `<iframe>` tag is used to embed another HTML document within the current HTML document.
            - `src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7poP4QV7kU"`: Specifies the URL of the document to embed.
              This is the embed URL for the YouTube video. Note that it's `youtube.com/embed/`
              and not the standard watch URL.
            - `title="YouTube video player about Abstract Expressionism"`: Provides an accessible title
              for the iframe, which is important for screen readers and SEO.
            - `frameborder="0"`: Removes the border around the iframe (modern CSS usually handles this).
            - `allow="..."`: Specifies a feature policy for the iframe, controlling what features
              (like accelerometer, autoplay, etc.) are available to the embedded content.
            - `referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"`: Controls how much referrer information
              is sent with requests initiated from the iframe.
            - `allowfullscreen`: Allows the user to toggle fullscreen mode for the video.
            Inside the `video-responsive` container, the CSS will make this iframe
            take up 100% width and height of its parent, ensuring it scales correctly.

        <h2>The Tate Modern: A Hub for Contemporary Art</h2>
        <p>
          The Tate Modern, located in London, is a world-renowned contemporary art museum.
          Housed in the former Bankside Power Station, its iconic architecture and vast
          collection make it a must-visit destination for art enthusiasts. It features
          works by international artists from 1900 to the present day, including
          masterpieces of Cubism, Surrealism, Pop Art, and more.

            The `<iframe>` tag for the Google Map embed.
            - `src="..."`: The embed URL provided by Google Maps for Tate Modern.
              This URL is quite long as it contains all the map coordinates and settings.
            - `width="600"` and `height="450"`: These are default dimensions provided
              by Google Maps. However, the CSS applied to `map-responsive` and the
              iframe itself (`width: 100%; height: 100%;`) will override these
              to ensure responsiveness.
            - `style="border:0;"`: Removes the default iframe border.
            - `allowfullscreen=""`: Allows the map to be viewed in fullscreen.
            - `loading="lazy"`: Suggests to the browser to load the iframe content
              only when it is near the viewport, improving initial page load performance.
            - `referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"`: Controls referrer information.
