<!-- 
Create a complete HTML5 page named fonts.html
that uses two different Google Fonts â€” one for all headings and a
different one for all paragraph text. Include a heading and at least two
styled paragraphs of placeholder content related to an art topic of
your choice. Link to both fonts using the Google Fonts embed method, and
apply them using CSS in an external stylesheet located at css/fonts.css.
Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag,
class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete
beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include
named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior.
Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use
placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the
page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- 
    The <head> element contains meta-information about the HTML document,
    such as its title, links to stylesheets, and character set. This content
    is not directly visible on the web page itself but is crucial for
    how the browser renders and interprets the page.
    -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- 
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    "UTF-8" is a universal character encoding that supports almost all characters
    and symbols in the world, making it the recommended choice for web pages.
    It ensures that text displays correctly across different browsers and operating systems.
    -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- 
    The <meta name="viewport"> tag is essential for responsive web design.
    - "width=device-width" sets the width of the viewport (the visible area of the web page)
      to the width of the device's screen. This means the page will adapt to the screen size.
    - "initial-scale=1.0" sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
      A value of 1.0 means no zoom, ensuring the page renders at its actual size,
      which is important for mobile devices.
    -->

    <title>Impressionism: Art of Light and Color</title>
    <!-- 
    The <title> tag defines the title of the HTML document. This title appears
    in the browser's title bar or tab. It's also used by search engines and
    when the page is bookmarked. Here, it describes the content of our page.
    -->

    <!-- Google Fonts Embed Method -->
    <!-- 
    These <link> tags are used to import custom fonts from Google Fonts.
    This is the recommended "embed method" for including Google Fonts in a web page.
    The 'href' attribute points to the CSS file provided by Google Fonts, which
    contains the @font-face rules necessary to load the specified fonts.
    -->
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <!-- 
    The <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com"> tag
    tells the browser to establish an early connection to the Google Fonts domain.
    This can speed up font loading because the browser can start the connection
    process (DNS lookup, TCP handshake, TLS negotiation) in the background
    before it even parses the CSS that requests the fonts. It's a performance optimization.
    -->
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <!-- 
    Similarly, <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    establishes an early connection to the domain where the font files themselves
    are hosted (gstatic.com). The 'crossorigin' attribute is necessary when fetching
    resources from a different origin (like Google Fonts) that might be subject
    to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies. It ensures the font files
    can be loaded securely.
    -->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:ital,wght@0,400..900;1,400..900&family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <!-- 
    This is the main <link> tag for importing the specific Google Fonts.
    - 'href': This URL is generated by Google Fonts and includes parameters
      for the selected font families ('Playfair Display' and 'Roboto'),
      their weights (from 400 to 900 for both, including italic versions),
      and 'display=swap'.
    - 'display=swap': This is a font-display descriptor. It tells the browser
      how to display text while the font is loading. 'swap' means that the
      browser will immediately render the text using a fallback system font
      (like Arial or Times New Roman) and then swap it with the custom font
      once it has loaded. This prevents invisible text (FOIT - Flash of Invisible Text)
      and improves perceived loading performance.
    - 'rel="stylesheet"': This attribute specifies the relationship of the linked
      document to the current document, indicating that it's a stylesheet.
    -->

    <!-- External Stylesheet Link -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/fonts.css">
    <!-- 
    This <link> tag connects our HTML document to an external CSS file named 'fonts.css'.
    - 'rel="stylesheet"': Again, this indicates it's a stylesheet.
    - 'href="css/fonts.css"': This specifies the path to our CSS file.
      It's located in a folder named 'css' within the same directory as this HTML file.
      Using external stylesheets is a best practice because it separates content (HTML)
      from presentation (CSS), making the code cleaner, easier to maintain, and
      allowing styles to be reused across multiple HTML pages.
    -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- 
    The <body> element contains all the visible content of the HTML document.
    This is where all the text, images, links, and other elements that a user
    will see and interact with are placed.
    -->

    <header>
        <!-- 
        The <header> element represents introductory content, typically a group
        of introductory or navigational aids. It's often used to contain
        headings, logos, navigation links, and search forms. Here, it holds
        our main page title.
        -->
        <h1>The Enchantment of Impressionism</h1>
        <!-- 
        The <h1> tag defines the most important heading on the page.
        There should typically only be one <h1> per page, representing the
        main topic or title. In our CSS, we will apply the 'Playfair Display'
        Google Font to all heading elements (h1-h6) to give them a distinct style.
        -->
    </header>

    <main>
        <!-- 
        The <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document.
        It should contain content that is unique to this document and excludes
        content that is repeated across a set of documents, such as sidebars,
        navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.
        It helps define the main section of the page's content.
        -->

        <section>
            <!-- 
            The <section> element is a generic standalone section of a document.
            It's used to group related content, and typically has a heading.
            Here, it groups our introductory paragraph about Impressionism.
            -->
            <h2>A Revolution in Light and Color</h2>
            <!-- 
            The <h2> tag defines a second-level heading, used for sub-sections
            or important topics within the main content. Like <h1>, it will
            inherit the 'Playfair Display' font from our CSS.
            -->
            <p>
                Impressionism, an art movement that emerged in the 19th century, marked a radical departure
                from traditional academic painting. Artists like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir,
                and Edgar Degas sought to capture the fleeting impressions of light and atmosphere,
                rather than precise detail. Their canvases became vibrant records of momentary sensations,
                often painted en plein air (outdoors) to directly observe the changing effects of sunlight
                on landscapes, cityscapes, and everyday life. This focus on perception over rigid form
                challenged the established art world and paved the way for modern art.
            </p>
            <!-- 
            The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text. This is the standard element
            for blocks of prose. In our CSS, we will apply the 'Roboto' Google Font
            to all paragraph elements to ensure readability and a clean appearance.
            -->
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Techniques and Legacy</h2>
            <!-- 
            Another <h2> heading for a new section, continuing the theme.
            -->
            <p>
                The Impressionists employed distinct techniques, including visible brushstrokes,
                open composition, and an emphasis on light in its changing qualities. They often
                used unmixed primary colors, applied in small dabs, allowing the viewer's eye
                to blend the colors optically. This innovative approach gave their paintings a
                fresh, spontaneous feel, capturing the essence of a scene rather than its exact
                photographic likeness. The movement's influence was profound, inspiring subsequent
                artistic styles like Post-Impressionism and laying foundational principles for
                the abstract art that followed. Its enduring appeal lies in its celebration of
                beauty in the ordinary and its masterful portrayal of light.
            </p>
            <!-- 
            Another <p> tag for additional paragraph content, also styled with 'Roboto'.
            -->
        </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!-- 
        The <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content
        or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about
        its section, such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data,
        and the like.
        -->
        <p>&copy; 2025 Art Appreciation. All rights reserved.</p>
