<!--
Full Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named loading.html that displays a centered loading animation or spinner on the screen. Use pure CSS to animate the spinner using @keyframes
 for either rotation or pulsing. The animation should run continuously
to indicate loading. Style everything using an external stylesheet
located at css/loading.css. The page should be minimal but
visually clear, with the spinner centered both vertically and
horizontally. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain
 every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a
complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to
include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction
behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML
file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to
complete the page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
  This is the document type declaration. It tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
  It's crucial for ensuring the browser renders the page in "standards mode."
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
  The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML page. All other elements are descendants of this tag.
  The 'lang="en"' attribute specifies the primary language of the document content as English.
  This is important for accessibility (screen readers) and search engine optimization.
-->
<head>
  <!--
    The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document.
    This information is not displayed directly on the web page but is essential for the browser,
    search engines, and other web services.
  -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!--
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character and symbol
    in the world, making it the recommended encoding for most web pages. It prevents
    issues with displaying special characters.
  -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <!--
    The <meta name="viewport"> tag is critical for responsive web design.
    - 'width=device-width': Sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device screen.
      This means the page will adapt to the screen size of the user's device (phone, tablet, desktop).
    - 'initial-scale=1.0': Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
      A value of 1.0 means no zoom, ensuring the page renders at its intended size.
  -->
  <title>Loading Art Collection</title>
  <!--
    The <title> tag defines the title of the HTML document.
    This title appears in the browser's title bar or tab, in search engine results,
    and as the default name when bookmarking the page. It should be concise and descriptive.
  -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/loading.css">
  <!--
    The <link> tag is used to link an external resource to the HTML document.
    - 'rel="stylesheet"': Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document.
      Here, it indicates that the linked file is a stylesheet.
    - 'href="css/loading.css"': Specifies the URL (path) of the external stylesheet.
      This tells the browser where to find the CSS file that will style this HTML page.
      In this case, it's located in a 'css' folder relative to the HTML file.
  -->
</head>
<body>
  <!--
    The <body> tag contains all the visible content of the HTML document.
    This includes text, images, videos, links, and any other elements that users see and interact with.
  -->

  <!--
    Color Scheme:
    - Background: A very light gray (#f5f5f5) to provide a soft, neutral canvas.
    - Spinner Border: A medium blue (#3498db) for visibility and a sense of progress.
    - Spinner Transparent Part: Transparent, allowing the background to show through, creating the "spinning" effect.
    - Text: A dark gray (#333) for readability against the light background.
  -->

  <!--
    Interaction Behavior:
    - The primary interaction behavior is that the loading spinner animates continuously.
      It provides visual feedback to the user that content is being loaded or processed in the background.
      There are no direct user interactions with the spinner itself, as its purpose is purely indicative.
  -->

  <div class="loader-wrapper">
    <!--
      This <div> acts as a wrapper for the loading spinner.
      - Class 'loader-wrapper': Used by CSS to style and position the spinner container.
        It helps in centering the spinner on the screen and can be used to apply
        a background overlay if needed (though not used for overlay here).
    -->
    <div class="spinner"></div>
    <!--
      This <div> is the actual element that will be styled as the loading spinner.
      - Class 'spinner': Used by CSS to define its shape (circle), border, and the animation.
        It's the visual component that rotates or pulses.
    -->
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <!--
      This <div> holds the main content of the page.
      - Class 'content': Used to style the placeholder content, ensuring it's
        visible and well-formatted below the loading spinner (conceptually,
        this content would appear after loading is complete, but for this example,
        it's shown alongside the spinner).
    -->
    <h1>The Renaissance Art Collection</h1>
    <!--
      The <h1> tag defines the main heading of the content.
      It's typically used for the most important title on the page.
    -->
    <p>

      a period of immense artistic and cultural flourishing from the 14th to the 17th century.

      timeless beauty that defined artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael.
    </p>
    <!--
      The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text. It's used for blocks of content.
    -->
    <p>
