<!--
Create a complete responsive HTML5 page named responsive.html
with three side-by-side content sections when viewed on a desktop
screen. On smaller screens such as tablets and phones, these three
sections should automatically stack vertically. Use either CSS Flexbox
or Grid for layout, and control the responsiveness using media queries.
Link to an external CSS file at css/responsive.css to
handle all styling and layout behavior. Assign each section a different
background color and include some text content about an art-related
topic in each one. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files;
explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're
walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be
sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and
interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top
of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your
choice to complete the page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!--
    The <head> element contains meta-information about the HTML document,
    such as its title, links to stylesheets, and other metadata.
    This information is not displayed on the web page itself but is
    used by browsers and search engines.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    UTF-8 is a universal character encoding that supports almost all characters
    and symbols in the world, ensuring that text is displayed correctly across
    different languages and platforms.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
    The <meta name="viewport"> tag is crucial for responsive web design.
    - "width=device-width": This sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen.
      This means the page will scale to fit the screen, rather than displaying a fixed-width desktop version.
    - "initial-scale=1.0": This sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
      A value of 1.0 means no zoom, displaying the page at its actual size relative to the device's resolution.
      This combination ensures the page looks good on various devices, from phones to desktops.
    -->
    <title>Responsive Art Gallery</title>
    <!--
    The <title> tag defines the title of the HTML document.
    This title appears in the browser's title bar or tab. It's important for SEO
    (Search Engine Optimization) and user experience, as it gives a quick overview
    of the page's content.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/responsive.css">
    <!--
    The <link> tag is used to link an external resource to the HTML document.
    - "rel="stylesheet"": This attribute specifies the relationship between the current document
      and the linked document. "stylesheet" indicates that the linked file is a stylesheet.
    - "href="css/responsive.css"": This attribute specifies the URL (path) of the external stylesheet file.
      In this case, it's located in a folder named 'css' and the file is 'responsive.css'.
      This separation of HTML structure and CSS styling is a best practice for maintainability.
    -->
</head>
<body>
    <!--
    The <body> element contains all the visible content of the HTML document,
    such as text, images, links, videos, and other interactive elements.
    -->

    <header class="page-header">
        <!--
        The <header> element represents introductory content, typically containing
        a group of navigational aids or introductory headings.
        - "class="page-header"": This class is used to apply specific styling
          to the header via CSS, such as background color, padding, and text alignment.
        -->
        <h1>The Evolving Canvas: A Journey Through Art</h1>
        <!--
        The <h1> tag defines the most important heading on the page.
        There should typically be only one <h1> per page for semantic clarity and SEO.
        -->
    </header>

    <main class="content-container">
        <!--
        The <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body>.
        It should contain content that is unique to the document and not
        repeated across a set of documents (like sidebars, navigation links, copyright information).
        - "class="content-container"": This class is applied to the main content area.
          In CSS, this class will be used to set up the Flexbox layout, allowing its
          child elements (the three sections) to arrange themselves side-by-side on
          larger screens and stack vertically on smaller screens.
        -->

        <section id="section1" class="content-section">
            <!--
            The <section> element is used to group related content.
            It's a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
            - "id="section1"": A unique identifier for this specific section.
              Used for targeting with CSS or JavaScript if needed.
            - "class="content-section"": A common class applied to all three sections.
              This allows for consistent styling (e.g., padding, margin) across all sections,
              while individual IDs can be used for unique properties like background colors.

            <h2>Impressionism: Capturing Fleeting Moments</h2>
            <!--
            The <h2> tag defines a secondary heading, less important than <h1>.
            -->
            <p>
                Impressionism, a 19th-century art movement, emerged in response to the rigid
                conventions of academic painting. Artists like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir,
                and Edgar Degas sought to capture the "impression" of a scene, focusing on light,
                color, and movement rather than precise detail. They often painted outdoors (en plein air)
                to observe the changing effects of natural light, using visible brushstrokes and
                a vibrant palette. This revolutionary approach paved the way for modern art,
                emphasizing subjective perception over objective reality.

            <h2>Cubism: Deconstructing Reality</h2>
            <p>
                Cubism, pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 20th century,
                revolutionized painting and sculpture by presenting multiple viewpoints of an object
                simultaneously. Instead of depicting objects from a single angle, Cubist artists
                broke them down into geometric shapes and reassembled them in an abstract form.
                This intellectual approach challenged traditional notions of perspective and representation,
                forcing viewers to engage with the artwork on a deeper, more analytical level.
                It marked a significant departure from centuries of Western art.

            <h2>Surrealism: Exploring the Subconscious</h2>
            <p>
                Surrealism, an artistic and literary movement that began in the 1920s,
                was heavily influenced by Sigmund Freud's theories of the unconscious mind.
                Led by André Breton, Surrealist artists like Salvador Dalí, René Magritte,
                and Joan Miró aimed to unlock the power of the imagination by juxtaposing
                unrelated objects in dreamlike and often bizarre scenarios. Their works
                explored themes of dreams, desires, and the irrational, creating a visual
                language that defied logic and embraced the fantastical.
