Prompt: Create a complete HTML5 page named advanced-work.html. The page must have a consistent <header> and <footer>. The main content must be a two-column layout. The left column should be ~60-70% of the width must contain a functional <model-viewer> element displaying the 3D model from https://modelviewer.dev/shared-assets/models/Astronaut.glb. The right column must contain the artwork's metadata, clearly structured with labels: "Title,""Artist,""Year,""Medium," and a "Description" with a paragraph of placeholder text. Metadata in the right column must use clear and readable typography to distinguish between labels and content. Make sure all styling must be in external CSS file (css/advanced-work.css). include "neurotically detailed comments" explaining the purpose and reasoning behind every HTML tag and CSS rule. Also include a full prompt comment block at the top of the main HTML file.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be an HTML5 document. It's crucial for browser rendering in standards mode. -->
<html lang="en">
<!-- The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML page. The 'lang="en"' attribute specifies the language of the document content, which helps search engines and assistive technologies. -->
<head>
    <!-- The <head> tag contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as its title, links to stylesheets, and other metadata. This content is not displayed on the web page itself. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is a universal character set that supports almost all characters and symbols in the world, preventing display issues. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- The <meta name="viewport"> tag is essential for responsive web design.
         'width=device-width' sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device.
         'initial-scale=1.0' sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
         This ensures the page scales correctly across different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). -->

                         'alt="A 3D model of an astronaut floating in space"' provides alternative text for the model, important for accessibility (screen readers) and when the model cannot be loaded.
                         'ar' (Augmented Reality) attribute enables AR functionality if the device supports it.
                         'ar-modes="webxr scene-viewer quick-look"' specifies the preferred AR modes. 'webxr' for immersive experiences, 'scene-viewer' for Android, 'quick-look' for iOS.
                         'environment-image="neutral"' sets a neutral environment image for lighting the model, providing a more realistic appearance.
                         'shadow-intensity="1"' controls the intensity of the shadow cast by the model. A value of 1 means full intensity.
                         'camera-controls' enables default camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom) via mouse or touch gestures.
                         'touch-action="pan-y"' optimizes touch interactions, allowing vertical panning on the model without interfering with page scrolling.
                         'auto-rotate' makes the model automatically rotate when loaded, providing an immediate dynamic view. -->
