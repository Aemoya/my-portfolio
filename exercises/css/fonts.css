They act as a basic reset to ensure consistent rendering across different browsers.

    /* 'font-family' specifies the typeface for the text.
    - 'Roboto': This is our primary font for paragraph text, loaded from Google Fonts.
    - 'sans-serif': This is a generic font family. If 'Roboto' fails to load for any reason,
      the browser will use a generic sans-serif font available on the user's system
      (e.g., Arial, Helvetica). This ensures that text is always displayed.
    */
    line-height: 1.6;
    /* 'line-height' sets the height of each line of text. A value of 1.6 (which is
    1.6 times the font size) provides good readability by adding sufficient
    vertical spacing between lines, preventing text from appearing too dense.

      against the light background, ensuring high readability without being
      as harsh as pure black. This is also part of our color scheme.

Named comments for clarity on our chosen color palette.
- Primary Background: #f8f8f8 (Very Light Grey / Off-White)
- Primary Text Color: #333333 (Dark Grey)
- Accent Color (for potential future use or subtle highlights): #607d8b (Muted Blue-Grey)
  (Not explicitly used in this basic example, but defined for consistency if more elements were added.)

    /* 'color' sets the text color for headings.
    - '#2c3e50': A dark, muted blue-grey. This color provides a good contrast
      with the background and differentiates headings from paragraph text,
      giving them a more prominent and artistic feel, fitting the art topic.
    */
    margin-top: 1.5em;

    /* 'border-bottom' adds a line below the <h2>.
    - '2px': The thickness of the line.
    - 'solid': The style of the line (a continuous line).
    - '#a7b7c7': A very light, muted blue-grey color for the line.
      This provides a subtle visual separation without being too distracting,
      adding a touch of elegance.
    */
    padding-bottom: 5px;
    /* 'padding-bottom' adds space between the text of the <h2> and its bottom border.

    default font size, improving readability, especially on larger screens.

    don't run into each other and are clearly separated.

    /* 'max-width' sets the maximum width an element can be. This prevents
    the content from stretching too wide on very large screens, which can
    make long lines of text difficult to read. 800px is a common readable width.

    margin-left: auto;
    /* 'margin-left: auto' in combination with 'margin-right: auto'

    to these sections. The '0' for top/bottom padding means no extra
    vertical padding is added here, as vertical spacing is handled by
    margins on individual elements. This ensures content doesn't touch
    the side edges when the screen is narrower than 800px.

    than the main content.

    subtle but still readable.

/* --- Interaction Behavior (Named Comment) --- */
/*
For this static page, there are no interactive elements (like buttons or links)
that require specific hover/active states. However, if there were:
- Links would have a subtle 'text-decoration: underline;' on hover.
- Buttons would have a 'background-color' or 'box-shadow' change on hover/active.
The goal would be to provide clear visual feedback to the user when they
interact with an element, indicating it is clickable or actionable.
