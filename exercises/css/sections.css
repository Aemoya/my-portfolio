/*
Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named sections.html with three stacked <section> blocks titled About, Work, and Contact. Link to an external CSS file (css/sections.css) that assigns each section a unique background color, adds padding, and centers the text. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

*/

/* --- Color Scheme Description ---
This color scheme aims for a sophisticated yet inviting feel, inspired by classic art palettes with a modern twist.

- Primary Backgrounds:
  - #FDFBF8 (Almost White/Off-White): Provides a clean, bright, and airy canvas, reminiscent of a fresh paper or primed canvas. It's very gentle on the eyes.
  - #E8E5E0 (Light Gray/Greige): A subtle, warm gray for contrast, evoking the natural tones found in stone or aged parchment. It provides a soft visual break.
  - #D2CDC3 (Medium Gray/Stone): A deeper, richer gray that offers more visual weight and distinction for the third section, akin to a subtle shadow or a deeper neutral tone in a painting.

- Text Color:
  - #333333 (Dark Charcoal Gray): A soft black that ensures readability without being as harsh as pure black. It provides good contrast against the light backgrounds.

- Accent/Link Color (Not explicitly used as a section background, but good to define for future use):
  - #785A75 (Muted Plum/Mauve): A sophisticated, slightly desaturated purple that can be used for links or subtle highlights, offering a touch of artistic flair without being overwhelming.

--- Interaction Behavior ---
For this specific exercise, the interaction behavior is minimal as per the prompt (no hover effects requested).
The primary interaction is simply presenting distinct visual sections with clear headings and readable content.
The background colors serve to visually separate the content blocks, guiding the user's eye through the page.
If hover effects were added, a slight darkening of the background or a subtle border change would be fitting
with this subdued palette.

body {
    /*
    The 'body' selector targets the entire content area of the HTML document.
    Styles applied here will affect the whole page unless overridden by more specific selectors.
    */
    font-family: 'Georgia', serif;
    /*
    'font-family' specifies the typeface for the text.
    - 'Georgia' is a classic, readable serif font, often used for body text due to its elegance
      and readability, reminiscent of print media.
    - 'serif' is a generic font family. If 'Georgia' is not available on the user's system,
      the browser will fall back to any available serif font, ensuring the text still has
      a traditional look with serifs (small decorative lines at the ends of strokes).
    */
    line-height: 1.6;
    /*
    'line-height' sets the height of each line of text.
    - '1.6' means the line height will be 1.6 times the font size. This adds extra space
      between lines, significantly improving readability, especially for paragraphs of text.
    */
    margin: 0;
    /*
    'margin' controls the space outside an element's border.

    'padding' controls the space between an element's content and its border.
    - '0' removes the default padding that browsers might apply, giving you full control
      over the layout.

    background-color: #FDFBF8; /* Overall page background - Light Off-White */
    /*
    'background-color' sets the background color of the element.
    - '#FDFBF8' is a very light, almost white color with a slight warmth,
      chosen to provide a soft and clean overall backdrop for the page.
    */
    color: #333333; /* Default text color - Dark Charcoal Gray */
    /*
    'color' sets the color of the text within the element.
    - '#333333' is a dark charcoal gray, chosen for readability and a softer contrast
      compared to pure black, making it less harsh on the eyes.

    'padding' sets the space between the content and the border of the element.

    'font-size' sets the size of the text.

      from stretching too far horizontally.

    margin: 0 auto;
    /*
    'margin: 0 auto' is a common technique to center a block-level element horizontally
    within its parent container.
    - '0' sets top and bottom margins to 0.
    - 'auto' tells the browser to automatically calculate equal left and right margins,
      effectively centering the element.

    'padding: 0 20px' adds horizontal padding to the main content area.
    - '0' sets top and bottom padding to 0.

    'box-shadow' adds a shadow effect to the element.
    - '0' (horizontal offset): no horizontal shadow.
    - '4px' (vertical offset): shadow extends 4 pixels downwards.
    - '8px' (blur radius): the shadow is blurred over 8 pixels, making it soft.
    - 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)' (color): a black color with an opacity of 0.1 (10% opaque).
      This creates a subtle, light shadow that gives the sections a slight "lift" effect,
      adding depth without being overly dominant.
