/*
Color Scheme:
- Primary Backgrounds (Solid Sections):
    - Light Grey: #f4f4f4 (soft, neutral base)
    - Slightly Darker Grey: #e0e0e0 (for subtle variation or footer-like sections)
- Text Colors:
    - Dark Grey: #333 (highly readable on light backgrounds)
    - White: #fff (for text on dark/image backgrounds)
- Heading Colors:
    - Darker Grey: #222 (for emphasis on light backgrounds)
- Parallax Overlay:
    - Semi-transparent Black: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) (to ensure text readability over images)

Interaction Behavior (Parallax):
The core parallax effect is achieved using `background-attachment: fixed;`.
When the user scrolls, the background image remains stationary relative to the viewport,
while the foreground content scrolls over it, creating the illusion of depth.
The `background-size: cover;` and `background-position: center center;` ensure the
image always fills the section and is centered, regardless of screen size.

/* Universal Box-Sizing */
*, *::before, *::after {
    /*
    The universal selector (*) targets all elements on the page.
    - "box-sizing: border-box;" is a fundamental CSS rule for layout.
    It changes how the total width and height of an element are calculated.
    Normally, padding and border are added *on top* of the specified width/height.
    With `border-box`, padding and border are *included* within the specified
    width/height. This makes layout calculations much more intuitive and
    predictable, especially in responsive designs.

/* Body Styling */
body {
    /*
    Styles applied to the <body> element affect the entire page.

    margin: 0;

    "margin: 0;" removes the default margin that browsers typically apply to the <body>.
    This ensures the content starts exactly at the edge of the viewport.
    */
    font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
    /*
    "font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;" sets the primary font for the entire page.
    'Inter' is a modern, highly readable typeface. 'sans-serif' is a generic
    font family fallback, meaning if 'Inter' isn't available, the browser will
    use a generic sans-serif font (like Arial, Helvetica) instead.
    */
    line-height: 1.6;
    /*
    "line-height: 1.6;" sets the spacing between lines of text. A value of 1.6
    (which means 160% of the font-size) provides good readability, preventing
    text from looking too cramped.
    */
    color: #333;

    "color: #333;" sets the default text color to a dark grey. This provides
    good contrast against light backgrounds, enhancing readability.

    lines of text from becoming too long on very wide screens, which can make
    them difficult to read.

    margin: 0 auto;
    /*
    "margin: 0 auto;" horizontally centers the block-level element within its parent.
    "0" sets top and bottom margins to zero, and "auto" distributes available
    horizontal space equally on the left and right.
    */
    padding: 60px 20px;
    /*
    "padding: 60px 20px;" adds internal spacing around the content.
    - "60px" for top and bottom padding, creating vertical breathing room.
