Neurotically detailed comments for css/scroll-reveal.css

This stylesheet defines the visual appearance and animation behavior
for the scroll-reveal effect on the HTML page. Every rule, class,
and color choice is explained below.
*/

/* --- Color Scheme --- */
/*
This section defines the color palette used throughout the page.
Choosing a consistent color scheme helps create a cohesive and
visually appealing design.

- Primary Background: A soft, light gray for a clean, modern look.
- Text Color: A dark charcoal gray for good readability against light backgrounds.
- Accent Color: A muted teal/blue for headings and subtle highlights,
  providing a touch of sophistication without being too overpowering.
- Section Background: A slightly darker, but still light, gray to
  differentiate content sections from the main background.
- Border Color: A very light gray to provide subtle separation.

    and reuse them throughout the stylesheet, making it easier to manage and update
    the color scheme globally.

/* --- Scroll Reveal Animation Behavior --- */
/*
This is the core of the scroll-reveal effect. It defines the initial
(hidden) state of the elements and their final (visible) state.

- Interaction Behavior:
  Elements with the 'scroll-reveal-section' class start in a 'hidden' state,
  meaning they are transparent and slightly moved downwards.
  When the JavaScript (using Intersection Observer) detects that these
  elements enter the viewport, it removes the 'hidden' class and adds
  the 'visible' class. The 'transition' property then smoothly animates
  the change from the 'hidden' state to the 'visible' state.
  This creates a subtle fade-in and slide-up effect as the user scrolls.
*/

.scroll-reveal-section {
    /*
    This class defines the initial state and the transition properties
    for all elements that will be animated.
    */
    opacity: 0;
    /*
    Starts the element completely transparent (invisible). This is the
    "fade-in" part of the animation.
    */
    transform: translateY(50px);
    /*
    Moves the element 50 pixels down from its original position. This is
    the "slide-up" part of the animation. When it becomes visible, it will
    slide up to its natural position (0px translateY).
    */
    transition: opacity 0.8s ease-out, transform 0.8s ease-out;
    /*
    Defines how the changes in 'opacity' and 'transform' properties will animate.
    - "opacity 0.8s ease-out": The opacity change will take 0.8 seconds to complete.
      "ease-out" means the animation will start fast and slow down towards the end,
      creating a smooth, natural feel.
    - "transform 0.8s ease-out": The transform (movement) change will also take
      0.8 seconds with an "ease-out" timing function.
    Combining these two creates a simultaneous fade-in and slide-up effect.
    */
    will-change: opacity, transform;
    /*
    This CSS property is a performance hint to the browser. It tells the browser
    that these properties are likely to change in the future, allowing it to
    optimize rendering by preparing for the animation in advance.
    */
}

.scroll-reveal-section.visible {
    /*
    This class is added by JavaScript when the section enters the viewport.
    It defines the final, visible state of the element.
    */
    opacity: 1;
    /*
    Makes the element fully opaque (visible). This is the target state for the fade-in.
    */
    transform: translateY(0);
    /*
    Moves the element back to its original vertical position (0 pixels from its start).
    This is the target state for the slide-up.
