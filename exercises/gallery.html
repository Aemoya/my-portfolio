                Welcome to "The Digital Canvas," an exhibition dedicated to the vibrant and ever-evolving world of abstract art.
                Here, we delve into the depths of color, form, and emotion, showcasing pieces that challenge perception
                and invite personal interpretation. Each artwork is a journey, a conversation between the artist's vision
                and your unique perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our collection highlights the beauty of non-representational forms, where lines dance, colors sing,
                and textures whisper stories untold. Prepare to immerse yourself in a realm where imagination reigns
                supreme and boundaries dissolve.

                    'alt' provides alternative text for the image, which is crucial
                    for accessibility (screen readers) and when the image cannot be displayed.
                    The 'onerror' attribute provides a fallback if the image fails to load,
                    displaying a placeholder image instead. This ensures the layout doesn't break
                    and the user still sees something.
