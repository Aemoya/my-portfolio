<!--
Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named scroll-reveal.html with at least five vertically stacked content sections. Each section
should contain a heading and paragraph of placeholder content about an art topic. Apply a scroll-triggered animation (such as fade-in or
slide-up) to each section using JavaScript and CSS. Use the Intersection Observer API in an external JavaScript file at scripts/scroll-reveal.js
to detect when each section enters the viewport. When a section is visible, add a CSS class that triggers a transition. Write all styling
and animation behavior in an external stylesheet at css/scroll-reveal.css. Ensure animations are subtle, accessible, and trigger progressively as
the user scrolls—not all at once or just at the end. Write neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule,
and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named comments
describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use placeholder
content about an art topic of your choice to complete the page.

    <!--
    The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document,
    such as its title, links to stylesheets, and scripts. This information
    is not displayed on the page itself but is crucial for browsers and search engines.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    UTF-8 is a universal character set that supports almost all characters and symbols
    in the world, ensuring that text displays correctly across different languages and systems.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
    The <meta name="viewport"> tag is essential for responsive web design.
    - "width=device-width" sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen.
    - "initial-scale=1.0" sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
    Together, these ensure the page scales correctly on various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).

    <title>Artistic Scroll Reveal</title>
    <!--
    The <title> tag defines the title of the document, which appears in the browser's
    title bar or tab. It's important for SEO and user experience.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/scroll-reveal.css">
    <!--
    The <link> tag is used to link an external stylesheet to the HTML document.
    - "rel="stylesheet"" specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document (it's a stylesheet).
    - "href="css/scroll-reveal.css"" provides the path to the CSS file.
    This separates styling from content, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

        <!--
        The <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body>.

              elements that should have the scroll-reveal animation applied.
            - "hidden": An initial class applied to make the section invisible
              and positioned for animation before JavaScript removes it.

            <p>
                The Renaissance, spanning roughly from the 14th to the 17th century,
                marked a profound period of cultural, artistic, political, and economic
                "rebirth" in Europe. Originating in Florence, Italy, it saw a renewed
                interest in classical Greek and Roman art, philosophy, and literature.
                Artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael pushed the
                boundaries of perspective, anatomy, and human emotion, creating masterpieces
                that continue to inspire awe. Their works often celebrated humanism,
                emphasizing the value and agency of human beings.

            <h2>Impressionism: Capturing Light and Moment</h2>
            <p>
                Emerging in the late 19th century in France, Impressionism was a radical
                departure from traditional academic painting. Artists like Claude Monet,
                Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas focused on capturing the fleeting
                effects of light and atmosphere, often painting outdoors (en plein air).
                Their brushstrokes were typically visible, colors vibrant, and compositions
                informal, aiming to convey the "impression" of a scene rather than precise
                details. This movement laid the groundwork for modern art, emphasizing
                subjective perception over objective reality.

            <h2>Surrealism: Dreams and the Unconscious</h2>
            <p>
                Surrealism, an artistic and literary movement that began in the 1920s,
                sought to unleash the creative potential of the unconscious mind.
                Influenced by Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theories, artists like
                Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, and Frida Kahlo explored dreamscapes,
                irrational juxtapositions, and symbolic imagery. Their works often
                challenged conventional notions of reality, inviting viewers into
                worlds where logic was suspended and the bizarre became beautiful.
                Surrealism aimed to revolutionize human experience by liberating
                imagination.

            <h2>Abstract Expressionism: Emotion on Canvas</h2>
            <p>
                Flourishing in New York City in the 1940s and 1950s, Abstract Expressionism
                was the first major American art movement to achieve international influence.
                Artists such as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning
                emphasized spontaneous, intuitive creation, often through large-scale,
                non-representational paintings. This movement valued the emotional and
                expressive power of color and form over narrative or figurative content,
                reflecting post-war anxieties and a desire for profound self-expression.
                It was characterized by intense energy and a direct engagement with the canvas.

            <h2>Contemporary Art: Diverse Voices and Forms</h2>
            <p>
                Contemporary art refers to art made in the present day, generally
                from the 1960s or 1970s up to the current moment. It is incredibly
                diverse, encompassing a vast array of styles, mediums, and conceptual
                approaches. Artists like Yayoi Kusama, Banksy, and Jeff Koons often
                engage with global issues, technology, identity, and social commentary.
                Contemporary art frequently blurs the lines between disciplines,
                incorporating performance, video, installation, and digital media,
                reflecting the complex and interconnected nature of our modern world.

    The <script> tag is used to embed or link executable code, typically JavaScript.
    - "src="scripts/scroll-reveal.js"" provides the path to the JavaScript file.
    - "defer": The "defer" attribute tells the browser to execute the script
      after the HTML document has been parsed. This is important because the
      script needs to access the DOM elements, which must be fully loaded first.
      Placing it just before the closing </body> tag is also a common practice
      for the same reason, but "defer" offers more flexibility.
