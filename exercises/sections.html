            <h2>About Artistic Movements</h2>
            <p>Art has evolved through countless movements, each reflecting the societal, philosophical, and technological shifts of its time. From the ethereal beauty of the Renaissance to the bold abstraction of Cubism, artists have continually pushed the boundaries of human expression. This section delves into the foundational ideas and defining characteristics of some of the most influential periods in art history.</p>
            <p>Understanding these movements is key to appreciating the depth and diversity of human creativity. It allows us to see how artists responded to their world, challenged conventions, and ultimately shaped the visual language we use today.</p>

            <h2>Notable Works and Artists</h2>
            <p>Within each artistic movement, certain works stand out as masterpieces, embodying the spirit and innovation of their era. Consider Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" from the High Renaissance, a paragon of sfumato and psychological depth, or Claude Monet's "Impression, Sunrise," which famously gave the Impressionist movement its name with its revolutionary depiction of light and atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Later, Pablo Picasso's "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" shattered traditional perspectives, ushering in Cubism with its fragmented forms and multiple viewpoints. More recently, Yayoi Kusama's immersive "Infinity Mirror Rooms" invite viewers into boundless, reflective spaces, demonstrating the enduring power of conceptual art.</p>
            <p>These works, and the artists behind them, are more than just beautiful objects; they are historical documents, cultural touchstones, and sources of endless inspiration.</p>
