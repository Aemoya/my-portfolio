    Full Prompt:
    Create a complete responsive HTML5 page named two-column.html
    with a main content area divided into two side-by-side columns using
    either CSS Flexbox or Grid. One column should include text content about
    an art-related topic, and the other should include an image from images/sample.jpg.
    Ensure the layout automatically collapses to a single-column layout on
    smaller screen sizes (such as tablets or phones). Link to an external
    CSS file at css/two-column.css to handle all visual styling
    and layout behavior. Be sure to clearly define breakpoints for
    responsive behavior using media queries, and ensure padding and spacing
    adjust appropriately at each size. Write neurotically detailed comments
    in all files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as
    if you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each
    choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme
    and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the
    top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your
    choice to complete the page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
    The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document as an HTML5 document.
    It's crucial for browsers to render the page in standards mode.
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
    The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML page.
    The 'lang="en"' attribute specifies the language of the document content
    as English. This is important for accessibility (screen readers) and
    search engine optimization.
-->
<head>
    <!--
        The <head> element contains meta-information about the HTML document.
        This information is not displayed directly on the web page but is
        used by browsers, search engines, and other web services.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
        The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
        UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes almost all characters
        and symbols in the world, preventing display issues with special characters.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
        The <meta name="viewport"> tag is critical for responsive web design.
        - 'width=device-width' sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device screen.
        - 'initial-scale=1.0' sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
        These two settings ensure that the page scales correctly on different devices,
        preventing horizontal scrolling on mobile phones.
    -->
    <title>Two-Column Responsive Layout</title>
    <!--
        The <title> tag defines the title of the HTML document.
        This title appears in the browser's title bar or tab, and is used
        as the default name when bookmarking the page.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/two-column.css">
    <!--
        The <link> tag is used to link an external resource to the HTML document.
        - 'rel="stylesheet"' specifies that the linked document is a stylesheet.
        - 'href="css/two-column.css"' specifies the path to the external CSS file.
        This separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making
        the code cleaner, easier to maintain, and allowing styles to be
        reused across multiple pages.
    -->
</head>
<body>
    <!--
        The <body> element contains all the visible content of the HTML document,
        such as text, images, links, videos, etc.
    -->
    <header>
        <!--
            The <header> element represents introductory content, typically
            containing one or more heading elements (<h1>-<h6>), logos,
            navigation, or other introductory material.
        -->
        <h1>Exploring Impressionism</h1>
        <!--
            The <h1> tag defines the most important heading on the page.
            There should typically be only one <h1> per page for semantic clarity
            and search engine optimization.
        -->
    </header>

    <main class="container">
        <!--
            The <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body>.
            It should contain content that is unique to the document and
            not repeated across a set of documents (like sidebars, navigation links,
            copyright information, etc.).
            The 'class="container"' is a custom class name that will be used
            in CSS to apply specific styling, in this case, to create the
            two-column layout using Flexbox.
        -->
        <section class="column text-content">
            <!--
                The <section> element groups together related content.
                It's a semantic element, meaning it adds meaning to the content.
                Here, it groups the text content about Impressionism.
                - 'class="column"' is a shared class for both columns to apply
                  common styling like padding.
                - 'class="text-content"' is a specific class for this column
                  to apply styles unique to the text content, if needed.
            -->
            <h2>The Dawn of Impressionism</h2>
            <!--
                The <h2> tag defines a secondary heading, less important than <h1>.
                It helps to structure the content hierarchically.
            -->
            <p>
                Impressionism was a 19th-century art movement characterized by
                relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition,
                emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities
                (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary
                subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of
                human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles.
                Radical for its time, it challenged the traditional academic
                painting styles prevalent in France.
            </p>
            <p>
                Artists like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas,
                and Camille Pissarro were central to this movement. They often
                painted outdoors (en plein air) to capture the fleeting effects
                of sunlight and atmosphere, moving away from strict realism
                towards a more subjective and immediate representation of their
                perceptions. Their work often featured landscapes, cityscapes,
                and scenes of modern life, reflecting the changing social
                landscape of the era.
            </p>

                The term "Impressionism" itself was coined by art critic Louis Leroy
                in 1874, initially as a derogatory remark, after viewing Monet's
                painting "Impression, Sunrise." However, the artists embraced the
                term, and it became synonymous with their revolutionary approach
                to art. The movement laid the groundwork for subsequent art
                movements like Post-Impressionism and Cubism, forever changing
                the trajectory of Western art.

            <!--
                This <section> element groups the image content.
                - 'class="column"' is shared for common styling.
                - 'class="image-content"' is specific for this column.

            <!--
                The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML document.
                - 'src="images/sample.jpg"' specifies the path to the image file.
                  This assumes there is an 'images' folder in the same directory
                  as the HTML file, containing 'sample.jpg'.
                - 'alt="..."' provides alternative text for the image. This is
                  crucial for accessibility (screen readers describe the image
                  to visually impaired users) and for SEO. It also displays
                  if the image fails to load.
