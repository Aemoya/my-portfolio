<!--
This is the complete HTML5 page named colors.html.
It features a single heading and two buttons, styled with a consistent brand-inspired color palette.
All styling is handled by an external stylesheet linked at css/colors.css.
Neurotically detailed comments are provided throughout, explaining every tag, class, style rule, and color value.
Named comments describe the color scheme and interaction behavior.
The full prompt is included as a comment at the top of this file.

Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named colors.html
 with a single heading and two buttons. Use a consistent brand-inspired
color palette with at least three custom colors: one for the background
of the page, one for the text color, and one for the button background
color. Apply a hover effect that changes the button background to a
complementary or contrasting color. Link to an external stylesheet at css/colors.css
 to handle all styling. Write neurotically detailed comments in all
files; explain every tag, class, style rule, and color value as if
you're walking a complete beginner through the reasoning behind each
choice. Be sure to include named comments describing your color scheme
and interaction behavior. Include this full prompt as a comment at the
top of the HTML file. Use placeholder content about an art topic of your
choice to complete the page.

<head>
    <!--
    The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document.
    This information is not displayed on the web page itself but is crucial for browsers and search engines.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character and symbol in the world,
    ensuring that text is displayed correctly across different browsers and operating systems.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
    The <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> tag is essential for responsive web design.
    - "width=device-width" tells the browser to set the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen.
    - "initial-scale=1.0" sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
    Together, these ensure the page scales correctly on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

    <title>Impressionist Art Palette</title>
    <!--
    The <title> tag sets the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
    It's also used by search engines and when the page is bookmarked.
    Here, it's set to "Impressionist Art Palette" to reflect the art topic chosen for the page content.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/colors.css">
    <!--
    The <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/colors.css"> tag links an external stylesheet to this HTML document.
    - "rel="stylesheet"" specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document (it's a stylesheet).
    - "href="css/colors.css"" provides the path to the CSS file.
    This separation of HTML (structure) and CSS (styling) is a best practice, making the code cleaner,
    easier to maintain, and allowing styles to be reused across multiple pages.
    -->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <!--
    This <link> tag imports the 'Inter' font from Google Fonts.
    - "href" points to the Google Fonts CSS file that defines the 'Inter' font.
    - "rel="stylesheet"" indicates it's a stylesheet.
    - "Inter:wght@400;700&display=swap" specifies that we want the regular (400) and bold (700) weights
      of the Inter font, and "display=swap" tells the browser to use a fallback font while Inter is loading,
      then swap it in once it's ready, improving perceived performance.
    'Inter' is chosen for its modern, clean, and highly readable appearance, suitable for a brand-inspired design.

<body>
    <!--
    The <body> section contains all the visible content of the HTML document.
    This is where the heading, paragraphs, buttons, images, and other elements that users see are placed.
    -->
    <div class="container">
        <!--
        The <div> tag is a generic container for flow content. It doesn't inherently represent anything
        but is used to group elements for styling purposes (e.g., applying a specific layout or background).
        Here, it's given the class "container" to act as a central wrapper for the page content,
        allowing for easy centering and consistent padding via CSS.
        -->
        <h1>The Luminous World of Impressionism</h1>
        <!--
        The <h1> tag defines the main heading of the page.
        There should typically be only one <h1> per page, representing the most important topic.
        Here, it introduces the art topic: "The Luminous World of Impressionism,"
        setting the theme for the color palette and content.
        -->
        <p>
            Impressionism, an art movement that emerged in the 19th century, revolutionized painting by focusing on
            capturing the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere. Artists like Monet, Renoir, and Degas
            used visible brushstrokes, open composition, and vibrant colors to depict scenes of modern life
            and landscapes, often painted en plein air (outdoors). Their aim was not to depict a subject with
            photographic realism, but to convey the "impression" of a moment, emphasizing how light changes
            and interacts with colors.
        </p>
        <!--
        The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text. It's used here to provide a brief
        introduction to Impressionism, serving as placeholder content related to the chosen art topic.
        -->
        <div class="button-group">
            <!--
            This <div> element with class "button-group" is used to group the two buttons together.
            This allows for easier styling of the buttons as a collective unit, for example,
            to apply consistent spacing between them or to center them.
            -->
            <button class="explore-button">Explore Masterpieces</button>
            <!--
            The <button> tag creates a clickable button.
            - "class="explore-button"" assigns a class to this specific button. While not strictly
              necessary for styling in this simple example (as all buttons will be styled similarly),
              it's good practice for potential future unique styling or JavaScript interactions.
            The text "Explore Masterpieces" provides a clear call to action related to the art theme.
            -->
            <button class="learn-more-button">Learn About Artists</button>
            <!--
            Another <button> tag, similar to the first.
            - "class="learn-more-button"" provides another specific class.
            The text "Learn About Artists" offers a different action, complementing the first button.
            Both buttons are designed to showcase the hover effect defined in the CSS.
            -->
