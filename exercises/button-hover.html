<!--
User Prompt:
Create a complete HTML5 page named button-hover.html that displays a large call-to-action button centered on the screen. Style the button in an external CSS file at css/button-hover.css
 using a custom background color, rounded corners, appropriate padding,
and a smooth hover transition. On hover, change the buttonâ€™s background
color to a clearly contrasting or visually engaging alternative. Write
neurotically detailed comments in all files; explain every tag, class,
style rule, and color value as if you're walking a complete beginner
through the reasoning behind each choice. Be sure to include named
comments describing your color scheme and interaction behavior. Include
this full prompt as a comment at the top of the HTML file. Use
placeholder content about an art topic of your choice to complete the
page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!--
    The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document,
    such as its title, links to stylesheets, and character set.
    This information is not directly displayed on the web page.
    -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
    The <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag specifies the character encoding for the document.
    "UTF-8" is a universal character encoding that supports almost all characters
    and symbols in the world, ensuring that text is displayed correctly across
    different browsers and operating systems. It's crucial for avoiding garbled text.
    -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
    The <meta name="viewport"> tag is essential for responsive web design.
    - "width=device-width": This sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen.
      This means the page will adapt to the screen size of the device (e.g., phone, tablet, desktop).
    - "initial-scale=1.0": This sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
      A value of 1.0 means no zooming, so the page appears at its actual size,
      which is generally desired for a consistent user experience.

    <title>Discover Impressionism - Button Hover Example</title>
    <!--
    The <title> tag defines the title of the HTML document.
    This title appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
    It's also used by search engines and when bookmarking the page.
    Here, it tells the user what the page is about: "Discover Impressionism"
    and indicates it's a "Button Hover Example" for clarity.
    -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/button-hover.css">
    <!--
    The <link> tag is used to link an external resource to the HTML document.
    - "rel="stylesheet"": This attribute specifies the relationship between the current
      document and the linked document. "stylesheet" indicates that the linked file
      is a cascading style sheet, which defines the visual presentation of the page.
    - "href="css/button-hover.css"": This attribute specifies the URL (path) of the
      external stylesheet file. In this case, it's located in a 'css' folder
      relative to the HTML file, and its name is 'button-hover.css'.
      This separation of HTML (structure) and CSS (style) is a best practice
      for maintainability and cleaner code.
    -->

    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <!--
    This link tag imports the 'Inter' font from Google Fonts.
    - "href" points to the Google Fonts API which provides the font files.
    - "family=Inter:wght@400;700": Requests the 'Inter' font with normal (400) and bold (700) weights.
    - "display=swap": This is a font-display descriptor that tells the browser
      how to display text while the font is loading. 'swap' means the browser
      will use a fallback font immediately and swap it with 'Inter' once it's loaded,
      improving perceived performance.

            <h3>What is Impressionism?</h3>
            <p>Impressionism was a 19th-century art movement characterized by
               relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition,
               emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities
               (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary
               subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of
               human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles.
               It originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent
               exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.
               The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work,
               'Impression, soleil levant' (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked
               the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review
               published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.</p>
